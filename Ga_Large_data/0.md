可看到hadoop 的四个组成：

The project includes these modules:

- **Hadoop Common**: The common utilities that support the other Hadoop modules. 为其他Hadoop模块提供基础设施
- **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS™)**: A distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to application data. 一个高可靠、高吞吐量的分布式文件系统
- **Hadoop YARN**: A framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management. 任务调度与资源管理
- **Hadoop MapReduce**: A YARN-based system for parallel processing of large data sets. 一个分布式的离线并行计算框架

和hadoop相关项目：

Other Hadoop-related projects at Apache include:

- [**Ambari™**](http://incubator.apache.org/ambari/): A web-based tool for provisioning, managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters which includes support for Hadoop HDFS, Hadoop MapReduce, Hive, HCatalog, HBase, ZooKeeper, Oozie, Pig and Sqoop. Ambari also provides a dashboard for viewing cluster health such as heatmaps and ability to view MapReduce, Pig and Hive applications visually along with features to diagnose their performance characteristics in a user-friendly manner.
- [**Avro™**](http://avro.apache.org/): A data serialization system.
- [**Cassandra™**](http://cassandra.apache.org/): A scalable multi-master database with no single points of failure.
- [**Chukwa™**](http://incubator.apache.org/chukwa/): A data collection system for managing large distributed systems.
- [**HBase™**](http://hbase.apache.org/): A scalable, distributed database that supports structured data storage for large tables.
- [**Hive™**](http://hive.apache.org/): A data warehouse infrastructure that provides data summarization and ad hoc querying.
- [**Mahout™**](http://mahout.apache.org/): A Scalable machine learning and data mining library.
- [**Pig™**](http://pig.apache.org/): A high-level data-flow language and execution framework for parallel computation.
- [**Spark™**](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/): A fast and general compute engine for Hadoop data. Spark provides a simple and expressive programming model that supports a wide range of applications, including ETL, machine learning, stream processing, and graph computation.
- [**Tez™**](http://tez.incubator.apache.org/): A generalized data-flow programming framework, built on Hadoop YARN, which provides a powerful and flexible engine to execute an arbitrary DAG of tasks to process data for both batch and interactive use-cases. Tez is being adopted by Hive™, Pig™ and other frameworks in the Hadoop ecosystem, and also by other commercial software (e.g. ETL tools), to replace Hadoop™ MapReduce as the underlying execution engine.
- [**ZooKeeper™**](http://zookeeper.apache.org/): A high-performance coordination service for distributed applications.
